\section{Expected results:} The input string index of 324 is invalid, input string of 1 is valid and the Turing machine starts, and running it again continues.
\section{Results:} The run command did reject 324, accepted 1 and started Turing machine. Finally it continued when used again on a running Turing machine.
\begin{verbatim}
