# TuringMachineSimulator

## Description
I had a class where we built a Turing machine simulator which will take a specially formatted file and simulate it.

## Turing machine definition and input string files
There are example files that demostrate the Definition files and the input string.

For more detail on the structure of each I wrote large requirements and design documents that will explain everything.

## Platform / How to run
The software will compile on Ubuntu using GCC, please use the make file.

To run do ./TMEXE Definitionfile without the .DEF.

## Overall design structure
